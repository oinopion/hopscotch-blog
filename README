== Hopscotch

Between fall 2009 and summer 2010 I was, together with Ola, exchange
student (Erasmus programme) at University of the West of Scotland.
During that time we maintained Polish-language weblog with photos. After
coming back we decided to leave the blog for future Erasmus students
going to UWS.
